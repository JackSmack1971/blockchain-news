# Security Remediation Guidelines

## Priority Framework
1. Address CRITICAL security issues first (authentication, encryption)
2. Implement HIGH security fixes (XSS, validation, cookies)
3. Apply MEDIUM improvements (performance, dependencies, HTTPS)
4. Complete LOW priority enhancements (logging, testing)

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode for all new security implementations
- Implement proper error handling with specific error types
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for security-critical functions
- Follow OWASP security best practices for web applications

## Verification Requirements
- Run `npm test` after each security fix
- Verify all authentication flows manually
- Test edge cases and malicious input scenarios
- Confirm proper cookie security settings in browser dev tools

## Security Implementation Rules
- Never store sensitive data in localStorage or unencrypted cookies
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs server-side
- Implement proper HTTPS enforcement for production
- Use Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS
- Apply principle of least privilege for all access controls

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Title format: [SECURITY] Brief description of fix
- Include security impact assessment in PR description
- Reference specific audit finding ID (e.g., SEC-2025-001)
- Provide before/after security comparison
- Include verification steps in PR description
# Security-Enhanced Development Guidelines

## Security-First Development Approach
This project implements comprehensive security measures. All future development must maintain these standards.

## Critical Security Rules
1. **Authentication**: Never bypass cryptographic verification for wallet-based authentication
2. **Session Management**: Always use whitelisted properties for session updates
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs server-side with proper schemas
4. **Security Headers**: Maintain comprehensive security header configuration
5. **Environment**: Validate all environment variables on startup

## Security Testing Requirements
- Run `npm run test:security` before any commit
- Verify `npm audit` shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
- Test all authentication flows manually
- Validate security headers in browser dev tools

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized  
- [ ] Security headers are not modified without security review
- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] Authentication flows include proper verification
- [ ] Rate limiting is applied to sensitive endpoints

## Security Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Monitor security logs for unusual patterns
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact of potential threats
3. **Response**: Follow incident response playbook
4. **Recovery**: Implement fixes and verify system integrity
5. **Review**: Document lessons learned and improve defenses

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Security events are logged to `logs/security.log`
- Metrics are available at `/metrics` endpoint
- Rate limiting violations trigger immediate alerts
- Failed authentication attempts are tracked and monitored

## Development Workflow
1. **Branch Protection**: All security-related changes require peer review
2. **Automated Testing**: Security tests run on every PR
3. **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of dependencies
4. **Environment Security**: Staging environment mirrors production security

## Emergency Procedures
- **Security Vulnerability**: Immediately notify security team
- **Breach Suspected**: Activate incident response plan
- **Rate Limit Bypass**: Check firewall and proxy configurations
- **Authentication Issues**: Verify certificate and key integrity

## Security Architecture Notes
- Web3 authentication uses nonce-based signature verification
- Session management prevents prototype pollution attacks
- All cookies use secure, httpOnly, and sameSite flags
- Database operations use connection pooling with encryption
- Environment variables are validated on application startup

Remember: Security is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, choose the more secure option.
